 * Builder for user types, such as MyFlatMutableBuilder, can behave as 
 * <b>sample builders</b>, when they build a sample, or <b>member builders</b> 
 * when they build a member for another Builder (such as the Builder returned
 * by MyFlatMutableBuilder::build_my_mutable()). All the other Builder types 
 * (sequences, arrays) are always member builders (such as the Builder returned
 * by MyFlatMutableBuilder::build_my_final_seq()).
 * 
 * Builders are <b>move-only</b> types. They cannot be copied, only moved. When
 * you assign a Builder as the return value of a function, this happens
 * automatically.
 * 
 * \code
 * // the return value of 'build_data' is moved into 'builder'
 * MyFlatMutableBuilder builder = rti::flat::build_data(writer);
 * \endcode
 * 
 * To explicitly move a Builder variable \if CPP_LANGUAGE_ONLY in
 * the Traditional C++ API, call its \p move() member function\else use \p std::move()
 * in C++11 platforms or call the \p move() member function in pre-C++11 platforms.
 * \endif
 * 
 * @section BuilderErrorManagement Builder Error Management
 * \if CPP_LANGUAGE_ONLY
 * The Traditional C++ API reports Builder errors by setting a flag
 * that can be checked with the member function \ref rti::flat::AbstractBuilder::check_failure()
 * "check_failure()". After each Builder operation, \p check_failure() must be
 * called to check (and clear) the error flag. 
 * 
 * In addition, in case of error, operations that return another Builder, such 
 * as MyFlatMutableBuilder::build_my_mutable(), return an invalid Builder
 * (\ref rti::flat::AbstractBuilder::is_valid() "is_valid()" is \p false). 
 * Operations that return an 
 * Offset, such as MyFlatMutableBuilder::add_my_final() return a "null" Offset 
 * when they fail (see \ref OffsetErrorManagement).
 * \endif
 * \if CPP2_LANGUAGE_ONLY
 * In the Modern C++ API errors are notified with exceptions. Builder operations
 * may throw the following exceptions
 * - dds::core::PreconditionNotMetError, for any precondition failure.
 * - dds::core::OutOfResourcesError, when the Builder's underlying buffer runs
 *   out of space (this should not happen when the Builder has been created with
 *   rti::flat::build_data()).
 * 
 * See also \ref OffsetErrorManagement.
 * \endif
 * 
 * @see MyFlatMutableBuilder for more information specific to builders for user
 * types.

/**
 * @ingroup RTIFlatBuildersModule
 * @brief Represents the Builder for an arbitrary user-defined mutable type
 * 
 * This example type represents the \ref RTIFlatBuildersModule "Builder" type
 * that \nddsgen would generate for \ref MyFlatMutable and allows creating a 
 * sample or a member of that type.
 * 
 * The most common way to create a Builder is rti::flat::build_data(), which
 * obtains a managed sample from a \idref_FooDataWriter as described in 
 * \ref PublishingFlatData. It is also possible to create a Builder with an
 * arbitrary buffer using the constructor that receives the buffer and its size.
 * 
 * When a Builder is created, the type is empty--it doesn't contain any members. 
 * The Builder provides functions to create each member. There are two kind of
 * functions: \p add functions and \p build functions.
 * 
 * Adding fixed-size members
 * -------------------------
 * Fixed-size members are "added", and the corresponding function is called 
 * \p <b>add_<member_name></b>. "Add" functions directly place the member in
 * the buffer, and return an \ref RTIFlatOffsetsModule "Offset" that allows
 * setting its values. 
 * 
 * By default, after calling \p add_<member_name> the
 * member values are uninitialized. This behavior can be changed by creating
 * the writer with 
 * \idref_DataWriterResourceLimitsQosPolicy_initialize_writer_loaned_sample; 
 * this is however not recommended in general because of the performance impact 
 * for large types.
 * 
 * \code 
 * MyFlatMutableBuilder builder = ...;
 * MyFinalFooOffset member_offset = builder.add_my_final();
 * member_offset.my_primitive(10);
 * // ... add/build more members
 * \endcode
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Building variable-size members
 * ------------------------------
 * Variable-size members are "built", and the function is called
 * \p <b>build_<member_name></b>. "Build" functions return another 
 * \ref RTIFlatBuildersModule "Builder" to build the member. 
 * 
 * \code
 * MyFlatMutableBuilder builder = ...;
 * auto member_builder = builder.build_my_mutable();
 * // ... use member_builder
 * member_builder.finish();
 * // ... add/build more members
 * \endcode
 * 
 * While a member is being built, the parent Builder is a <b>bound</b> state,
 * which prevents any changes to it until the member has been finished by calling
 * \p member_builder.finish(). In particular, the member Builder must be finished
 * before adding or building any other member, or before finishing \p builder.
 * 
 * Choosing which members are included
 * -----------------------------------
 * The \p add/build function for each member can be called one or zero times. 
 * That is, all members are optional, even those without the \p \@optional IDL
 * annotation. However \p \@key member must be added or \idref_FooDataWriter_write
 * will fail.
 * 
 * FlatData samples received by \idref_DataReader will not
 * contain the members that were not added/built--the corresponding member getters 
 * return a null Offset. A \idref_DataReader for an equivalent non-FlatData 
 * (plain) definition of this type will assign default values to any non-optional 
 * members that were not present in the sample when written.
 * 
 * It is not permitted to add a member more than once, but builders don't enforce
 * this. Trying to build/add a member more than once may cause the Builder to
 * overflow (see \ref BuilderErrorManagement). If it doesn't, it may be 
 * possible to write and read the data samples, but the duplicate members will 
 * be ignored.
 *
