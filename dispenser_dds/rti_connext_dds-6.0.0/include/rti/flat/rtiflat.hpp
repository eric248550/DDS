/** 
 * @defgroup RTIFlatDataModule FlatData Topic-Types
 * @ingroup DDSTopicModule
 * @brief @st_ext FlatData Language Binding for IDL topic-types
 *
 * @note For a complete description of the FlatData language binding and its
 * benefits, and a tutorial, see the "Sending Large Data" chapter in the 
 * <b>\ndds User's Manual</b>.
 * 
 * @note For buildable <b>code examples</b>, 
 * see https://community.rti.com/kb/flatdata-and-zerocopy-examples.
 * 
 * @note The FlatData language binding is available in the Traditional C++ API 
 * and in the Modern C++ API.
 * 
 * RTI FlatData&trade; is a language binding for IDL types in which the in-memory  
 * representation of a sample matches the wire representation. Therefore, the 
 * cost of serialization/deserialization is zero.
 * 
 * To select FlatData as the language binding of a type, annotate it with 
 * \p \@language_binding(FLAT_DATA) in IDL or apply the attribute 
 * \p languageBinding="flat_data" in XML.
 * 
 * There are some restrictions regarding the kinds of types to which the 
 * FlatData language binding can be applied. 
 * 
 * - For final types, the FlatData language binding can be applied only to 
 * fixed-size types. A fixed-size type is a type whose wire representation 
 * always has the same size. This includes primitive types, arrays of 
 * fixed-size types, and structs containing only members of fixed-size types. 
 * Unions are not fixed-size types.
 * - For mutable types, any member is permitted.
 * - Extensible types cannot be marked as FlatData.
 * 
 * Final types are more efficient, but more restrictive. In general, a good
 * compromise is to define mutable top-level types, but making sure their
 * largest data members are final.
 * 
 * When a type is marked with the FlatData language binding, its mapping into
 * C++ is different than that of a regular type (plain language binding). Rather
 * than a single C++ class with direct access to its members, for a FlatData
 * type \nddsgen generates the following:
 * 
 * \li A \ref RTIFlatSampleModule "Sample", the data in serialized format
 * \li An \ref RTIFlatOffsetsModule "Offset", which allows reading the data 
 *     members of that type inside a Sample, and modifying them without changing
 *     the size
 * \li A \ref RTIFlatBuildersModule "Builder", if the type is mutable, which 
 *     allows creating a variable-size Sample
 * 
 * For example, for the IDL types \ref MyFlatFinal and \ref MyFlatMutable 
 * \nddsgen generates the following C++ types:
 * \li The Sample types \ref MyFlatFinal and \ref MyFlatMutable
 * \li The Offset types MyFlatFinalOffset and MyFlatMutableOffset.
 * \li The Builder type MyFlatMutableBuilder.
 * 
 * @section PublishingFlatData Publishing FlatData
 * The typical way to publish FlatData samples includes the following steps:
 * - Create a \idref_FooDataWriter as you would for a non-FlatData (plain) 
 *   topic-type (see \ref DDSWriterExampleModule_writer_setup).
 * 
 * (For final topic-types such as \ref MyFlatFinal)
 * - Obtain a FlatData sample with \idref_FooDataWriter_get_loan.
 * \code
 * MyFlatFinal *foo_sample = writer.get_loan();
 * \endcode
 * 
 * - Initialize the sample, starting from the \ref rti::flat::Sample::root "root()" offset.
 * \code
 * MyFlatFinalOffset foo_root = foo_sample->root();
 * foo_root.my_primitive(3);
 * auto my_complex_offset = foo_root.my_complex();
 * // ... initialize my_complex_offset 
 * \endcode
 * 
 * (For mutable topic-types such as \ref MyFlatMutable)
 * - Obtain a \ref RTIFlatBuildersModule "Builder" to create a variable-size 
 *   sample with rti::flat::build_data().
 * \code
 * MyFlatMutableBuilder foo_builder = rti::flat::build_data(writer);
 * \endcode
 * 
 * - Use this builder (and possibly nested member builders) to initialize the
 *   members.
 * \code
 * foo_builder.add_my_primitive(3);
 * auto my_mutable_builder = foo_builder.build_my_mutable();
 * // ... build 'my_mutable' (a member with a mutable type)
 * my_mutable_builder.finish(); // completes a member
 * auto my_final_offset = foo_builder.add_my_final();
 * // ... initialize 'my_final' (a member with a final type)
 * \endcode
 * 
 * - Obtain the completed sample with MyFlatMutableBuilder::finish_sample(). After
 * that, the builder is no longer usable, and the sample size cannot change.
 * \code
 * MyFlatMutable *foo_sample = foo_builder.finish_sample();
 * \endcode
 * - Optionally, it is possible to change the values of the sample accessing
 * its root(), as long as the size doesn't change. For example, if the sample
 * was built with a sequence member with two elements, it is possible to modify
 * any of those elements, but it's not possible to add a third element.
 * 
 * (For both final and mutable topic-types)
 * - Write the sample with \idref_FooDataWriter_write.
 * \code
 * writer.write(*foo_sample);
 * \endcode
 * 
 * After write, the DataWriter owns the FlatData sample. This allows avoiding
 * additional copies, the main goal of the FlatData language binding. This
 * means that the sample cannot be reused. The DataWriter will return it to the
 * sample pool when appropriate, as described in \idref_FooDataWriter_get_loan.
 * 
 * @section SubscribingFlatData Subscribing to FlatData
 * 
 * To subscribe to a topic using a FlatData topic-type:
 * - Create a \idref_FooDataReader normally (see 
 *   \ref DDSReaderExampleModule_reader_setup).
 * - Read or take the samples using a loaning operation, such as 
 *   \idref_FooDataReader_take (copying read/take operations cannot be used 
 *   with FlatData types).
 * - Access the \ref rti::flat::Sample::root "root()" offset, and any of the 
 *   sample's members from there.
 * 
 * Note that the language binding is a local concept. It is possible
 * to publish with a FlatData topic-type and subscribe to it with a <b>plain</b>
 * topic-type with the same (or assignable) definition. It is also possible to
 * use a plain topic-type on the publisher side and subscribe to it using FlatData.
 * The DataWriter or DataReader of the plain topic-type has to use
 * \idref_XCDR2_DATA_REPRESENTATION in \idref_DataRepresentationQosPolicy.
