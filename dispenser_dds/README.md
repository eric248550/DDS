## Conclusion

1. We have successfully installed and run RTI-DDS Connext 6.0.1 on an Virtual Ubuntu Instance running on Vagrant
2. This Instance will be our development environment for further development,testing & etc
3. If memory resources came to your concern, this instance could act as a temporary storage server (which we'll be doing in [2_MongoDBCluster](../2_MongoDB\ Cluster\ Setup/))
